        <p><h3>Phytoplankton obtain their energy through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis" >photosynthesis</a>, as do trees and other plants on land. This means phytoplankton must have light from the sun, so they live in the well-lit surface layers (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphotic_zone">euphotic zone</a>) of oceans and lakes. In comparison with terrestrial plants, phytoplankton are distributed over a larger surface area, are exposed to less seasonal variation and have markedly faster turnover rates than trees (days versus decades). As a result, phytoplankton respond rapidly on a global scale to climate variations.</h3>

        <p><h3>Phytoplankton form the base of marine and freshwater food webs and are key players in the global <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_cycle" >carbon cycle</a>. They account for about half of global photosynthetic activity and at least half of the oxygen production, despite amounting to only about 1% of the global plant biomass. Phytoplankton are very diverse, varying from photosynthesizing bacteria to plant-like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algae" >algae</a> to armour-plated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccolithophore" >coccolithophores</a>. Important groups of phytoplankton include the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatom" >diatoms</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanobacteria" >cyanobacteria</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinoflagellate" >dinoflagellates</a>, although many other groups are represented.</h3>
        </p><p>Most phytoplankton are too small to be individually seen with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_eye">unaided eye</a>. However, when present in high enough numbers, some varieties may be noticeable as colored patches on the water surface due to the presence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorophyll" >chlorophyll</a> within their cells and accessory pigments (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phycobiliprotein" >phycobiliproteins</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanthophyll" >xanthophylls</a>) in some species.

    <p>Most phytoplankton are too small to be individually seen with the <a href="/wiki/Naked_eye" title="Naked eye">unaided eye</a>.

    </p><p>Phytoplankton are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesizing" >photosynthesizing</a> microscopic protists and bacteria that inhabit the upper sunlit layer of marine and fresh water bodies of water on Earth. Paralleling plants on land, phytoplankton undertake <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_primary_production" >primary production</a> in water,creating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound">organic compounds</a> from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> dissolved in the water.

    </p><p>"Marine photosynthesis is dominated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microalgae" >microalgae</a>, which together with cyanobacteria, are collectively called phytoplankton. Phytoplankton are extremely diverse, varying from photosynthesizing bacteria (cyanobacteria), to plant-like diatoms, to armour-plated coccolithophores.
