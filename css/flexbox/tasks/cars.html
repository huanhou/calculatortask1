            <td><p>The BMW X5 is a mid-size luxury crossover SUV produced by BMW.[1] The X5 made its debut in 1999 as the E53 model. It was BMW's first SUV. At launch, it featured all-wheel drive and was available with either a manual or automatic gearbox. The second generation was launched in 2006, and was known internally as the E70. The E70 featured the torque-split capable xDrive all-wheel drive system mated to an automatic gearbox. In 2009, the X5 M performance variant was released as a 2010 model.
                BMW marketed the X5 officially as a "Sports Activity Vehicle" (SAV),[3] rather than an SUV, to indicate its on-road handling capability despite its large dimensions.[4] The X5 signaled a shift away from the utilisation of body-on-frame construction, in favour of more modern monocoque chassis construction. Although the Mercedes-Benz M-Class was introduced more than a year prior to the X5, the X5 was the first to utilise a monocoque chassis. The M-Class used body-on-frame construction until its second generation.</p></td>

            <td><p>The Porsche Cayenne is a series of automobiles manufactured by the German company Porsche since 2002. It is a luxury crossover SUV and has been described as both a full-sized and a mid-sized vehicle.[1][2][3][4][5][6] The first generation was known internally within Porsche as the Type 9PA (955/957) or E1. It was the first V8-engined vehicle built by Porsche since 1995, when the Porsche 928 was discontinued. It is also Porsche's first off-road variant vehicle since its Super and Junior tractors of the 1950s, and the first Porsche with four doors. Since 2014, the Cayenne has been sold alongside a smaller Porsche SUV, the Macan.

                The second-generation Cayenne (Type 92A or E2) was unveiled at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show in March. The Cayenne shares its platform, body frame, doors and electronics with the similar Volkswagen Touareg and Audi Q7. It received a facelift in 2014 with minor external changes, and introduced a new plug-in E-Hybrid version, with its public launch at the Paris Motor Show.[7] Since 2008, all engines have featured direct injection technology. The third generation (Type PO536) was unveiled in 2017 at Stuttgart.</p></td>
