Many people are loyal to her because of this like Hailan, Xiangjian, Meiruo, Rongpei, Sanbao, Suoxin, etc. Even Hongli's servants Yuhu and Li Yu see how good she is (Ruyi is cordial to Yuhu and Ruyi treated Li Yu's wounds). Of course, there are people who don't like Ruyi but there are mostly the antagonists who want power and want to ruin Ruyi.</td>
    <td>All-Loving Hero: From the beginning to the end, she was a truly sincere, good woman in a place where power conflicts and corruption boils.
